This project a self-hosted video game review aggregatorâ€”a one-stop destination for gamers to get comprehensive insights and reviews for their favorite titles. By pulling data from reputable sources like Steam, MetaCritic, and OpenCritic, this platform aims to streamline the gaming experience, offering users a holistic view of a game's reception from both critics and players alike.

Using web-scraping techniques, the platform will gather reviews, ratings, and other relevant information for a given game across multiple sites and save it to a MySQL database. Users can then search for a game and view its overall rating, along with links to individual reviews and ratings from different sources. This program tracks the distribution of scores across different platforms and adjusts them to average out biases in scoring systems. This information will provide a more comprehensive and accurate depiction of a game's reception, allowing users to decide which games to play.
